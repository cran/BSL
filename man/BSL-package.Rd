\title{Bayesian synthetic likelihood}
\description{
Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL, Price et al (2018)) is an alternative to standard,
non-parametric approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). BSL assumes a multivariate normal distribution
for the summary statistic likelihood and it is suitable when the distribution of the model summary
statistics is sufficiently regular.

In this package, a Metropolis Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MH-MCMC) implementation of BSL is available.
We also include implementations of three methods (BSL, uBSL and semiBSL) and two shrinkage estimations 
(graphical lasso and Warton's estimation).

Methods:
(1) BSL (Price et al., 2018), which is the standard form of Bayesian synthetic likelihood, assumes the summary 
statistic is roughly multivariate normal; (2) uBSL (Price et al., 2018), which uses an unbiased estimator to 
the normal density; and (3) semiBSL (An et al. 2018), which relaxes the normality assumption to an extent and 
maintains the computational advantages of BSL without any tuning. 

Shrinkage estimations are designed particularly to reduce the number of simulations if method is BSL or semiBSL:
(1) graphical lasso (Friedman et al., 2008) finds a sparse precision matrix with a L1-regularised log-likelihood.
(An et al., 2019) use graphical lasso within BSL to bring down the number of simulations significantly when 
the dimension of the summary statistic is high; and (2) Warton's estimator (Warton 2008) penalises the 
correlation matrix and is straightforward to compute.

Parallel computing is supported through the \code{foreach} package and users can specify their own parallel
backend by using packages like \code{doParallel} or \code{doMC}. Alternatively a vectorised simulation function
that simultaneously generates \code{n} simulation results is also supported.

The main functionality is available through

\itemize{
     \item \code{\link{bsl}}: The general function to perform BSL, uBSL, and semiBSL (with or without 
         parallel computing).
     \item \code{\link{selectPenalty}}: A function to select the penalty for BSL and semiBSL.
}

Several examples have also been included. These examples can be used to reproduce the results of An et al. (2019), 
and can help practitioners learn how to use the package.

\itemize{
     \item \code{\link{ma2}}: The MA(2) example from An et al. (2019).
     \item \code{\link{mgnk}}: The multivariate G&K example from An et al. (2019).
     \item \code{\link{cell}}: The cell biology example from Price et al. (2018) and An et al. (2019).
}

Extensions to this package are planned.
