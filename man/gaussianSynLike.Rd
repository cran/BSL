\title{Estimating the Gaussian synthetic likelihood}
\usage{
gaussianSynLike(ssy, ssx, shrinkage = NULL, penalty = NULL,
  standardise = FALSE, GRC = FALSE, log = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ssy}{The observed summary statisic.}

\item{ssx}{A matrix of the simulated summary statistics. The number of rows is the same
as the number of simulations per iteration.}

\item{shrinkage}{A string argument indicating which shrinkage method to be used. The default is \code{NULL},
which means no shrinkage is used. Shrinkage estimation is only available for method ``BSL'' and ``semiBSL''. Current options 
are ``glasso'' for the graphical lasso method of Friedman et al (2008) and ``Warton'' for the ridge regularisation method 
of Warton (2008).}

\item{penalty}{The penalty value to be used for the specified shrinkage method. Must be between zero and one
if the shrinkage method is ``Warton''.}

\item{standardise}{A logical argument that determines whether to standardise the summary statistics before applying
the graphical lasso. This is only valid if method is ``BSL'', shrinkage is ``glasso'' and penalty is not \code{NULL}. The 
diagonal elements will not be penalised if the shrinkage method is ``glasso''. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{GRC}{A logical argument indicating whether the Gaussian rank correlation matrix (Boudt et al., 2012) 
should be used to estimate the covariance matrix in ``BSL'' method. The default is \code{FALSE}, which uses the 
sample covariance by default.}

\item{log}{A logical argument indicating if the log of likelihood is given as the result.
The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical argument indicating whether an error message should be printed if
the function fails to compute a likelihood. The default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The estimated synthetic (log) likelihood value.
}
\description{
This function estimates the Gaussian synthetic likelihood function of Wood (2010).
Shrinkage on the Gaussian covariance matrix is also available (see An et al 2019).

\examples{
data(ma2)
y <- ma2$data # the observed data

theta_true <- c(0.6, 0.2)
x <- matrix(0, 300, 50)
set.seed(100)
for(i in 1:300) x[i, ] <- ma2_sim(theta_true, 50)

# the standard Gaussian synthetic likelihood (the likelihood estimator used in BSL)
gaussianSynLike(y, x)
# the Gaussian synthetic likelihood with glasso shrinkage estimation
# (the likelihood estimator used in BSLasso)
gaussianSynLike(y, x, shrinkage = 'glasso', penalty = 0.1)
# the Gaussian synthetic likelihood with Warton shrinkage estimation
gaussianSynLike(y, x, shrinkage = 'Warton', penalty = 0.9)
